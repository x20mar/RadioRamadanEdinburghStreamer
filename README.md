RadioRamadanEdinburghStreamer
=============================

So every year Radio Ramadan Edinburgh broadcasts in the month of Ramadan, which is good and all but they broadcast at a very low frequecy which is hard to tune in to and they rely on a "Flash Streamer" to broadcast this on the internet.

Unfortunatly that won't work on mobile devices such as Android and iOS which do not support flash.

The aim of this project is to devlop a Javascript Solution that will work on all devices.
